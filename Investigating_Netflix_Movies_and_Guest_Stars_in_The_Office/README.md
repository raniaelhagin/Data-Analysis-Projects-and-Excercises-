In this project, We invistigated Netflix Movies to get an insightful about the duration of the movies. We appplied EDA on two categories:  

1. On friend's data: given the average duartions movie during the period from 2011 to 2020.
2. On a dataset for Netflix that contains large samples of the movies dring the period from 1925 to 2021 and of different genres 

We also gained experience in **Exploratory Data Analysis**, allowing us to manipulate raw data "Netflix data" and draw conclusions based on the visualizations of the data we created
