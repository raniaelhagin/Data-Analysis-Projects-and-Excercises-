In this project, We invistigated Netflix Movies to get insights about the duration of the movies. We appplied EDA on two categories:  

1. On friend's data: given the average duartions movie during the period from 2011 to 2020.
2. On a dataset for Netflix that contains large samples of the movies, tv shows, ...etc. during the period from 1925 to 2021, and of different genres. 

We also gained experience in **Exploratory Data Analysis**, allowing us to manipulate raw data, "Netflix data", and draw conclusions based on the visualizations of the data we created
